# Roadmap

## Direction
- Refactor and clean up the current codebase before adding new features.
- Make the reader generic across PDFs (no bundled book required).
- Keep the provider layer interchangeable and backend-only for secrets.
- Improve sectioning beyond fixed page blocks.
- Clarify and simplify backend flows and naming.
- Tighten the reading + chat UX based on actual usage.
- Add minimal tests around sectioning and provider configuration.

## Done
- Added a root `.gitignore` for local data, dependencies, and PDFs.
- Added `README.md` for setup and usage.
- Replaced `SPEC.md` with `ARCHITECTURE.md` for current system context.
- Added `ROADMAP.md` to track direction and completed work.
